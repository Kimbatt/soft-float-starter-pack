# Soft float starter pack
Software implementation of floating point numbers and operations.  
Soft floats can be used for deterministic calculations, e.g. for physics simulation.  
They will give the same results every time, on every platform, on every processor.  
  
This repository uses the work of:
- [SoftFloat](https://github.com/CodesInChaos/SoftFloat), which implements basic soft float functionality
- [libm](https://github.com/rust-lang/libm), which implements various operations for floating point numbers, including square root, trigonometric functions, transcendental functions, etc. (ported to C#)
